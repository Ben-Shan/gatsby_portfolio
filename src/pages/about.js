          <h2 id="introduction">About Me</h2>
          <p>
            Hello! I'm Ben, I'm a passionate UX Product Designer with a love for creating incredible experiences and helping people and teams achieve their potential. This year I have also began to foster a keen interest for AI and in how it will revolutionize, not only the design industry, but the wider technology sector.
          </p>

          <h3 id="professional-experience">Professional Journey</h3>
          <p>
            I'm currently in Aer Lingus, Ireland's flag carrier airline, enhancing our user interface to ensure a seamless purchasing and travel experience. I also have contributed significantly to bolstering company profits by crafting compelling interfaces. 
          </p>
          <p>
            To achieve success in each project, I follow the same process while tweaking for the specific needs:
          </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>Collaboration:</strong> I work closely with product managers and stakeholders, ensuring alignment on scope and expected outcomes.</li>
                <li> <strong>UX Research:</strong> While working closely with UX Researchers, this can involve: Reviewing user feedback, Conducting competitor analyses, Distributing surveys, Performing tree testing or others depending on the requirements.
                        
                    
                </li>
                <li> <strong>Ideation:</strong> I transition from paper sketches to low-fidelity Figma prototypes, visualizing potential solutions.</li>
                <li> <strong>Validation & Iteration:</strong> Designs undergo validation with stakeholders and fellow designers, and I iterate as required.</li>
                <li> <strong>Design System:</strong> If components are missing, I ensure they're crafted and added post-project completion.</li>
                <li> <strong>A/B Testing:</strong> It's a regular step, but sometimes, in-house assessments also guide our design choices.</li>
                <li> <strong>Finalization:</strong> Once a design is settled, I collaborate with developers all the way up to deployment.</li>
            </ul>

          <h3 id="insights">Personal Insights</h3>
          <p>
            One of my favourite aspects of being a UX Product Designer is the diversity in roles and responsibilities it brings. Engaging with diverse teams, from designers and product managers to legal and operations, and the constant requirement to be a source of truth for information and design solutions is exhilarating. These are crucial requirements in my current role but with my growing love for them I aim to move into a management role in my future career where these talents are even more essential.
